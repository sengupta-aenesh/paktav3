# Critical Fixes Applied - Notification Migration Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Page Error - "toast is not defined"
**Issue**: Dashboard page had `toast` in useEffect dependency array causing runtime error
**Fix**: 
- Removed `toast` from dependency array in line 299
- Removed Toast component rendering block
- Fixed all notification hook declarations

### 2. Template Analysis Not Working
**Issue**: TemplateAnalysis component requires onToast prop that was removed
**Fix**: 
- Added onToast prop back with adapter function that maps to notification system
- Provides backward compatibility while using new notification system internally

### 3. Subscription Page Errors
**Issue**: Using wrong toast import from 'sonner' package
**Fix**:
- Replaced `import { toast } from 'sonner'` with notification hooks
- Updated all toast calls to use notifications

### 4. use-subscription Hook
**Issue**: Hook was importing toast from sonner
**Fix**:
- Removed toast import
- Changed to console.warn (components handle notifications)

### 5. All Remaining Toast Rendering
**Issue**: Several components still had Toast component rendering blocks
**Fix**:
- Removed all Toast rendering blocks from:
  - dashboard/page.tsx
  - auth/login/page.tsx  
  - contract-creator/page.tsx
  - folders pages
  - grid components

## Contract Upload Functionality

The contract upload functionality code is intact and should work:
- Upload handlers are properly defined
- mammoth import is correct
- File extraction logic is unchanged
- All notification calls have been updated

If uploads are still not working, check:
1. Browser console for specific errors
2. Network tab for API failures
3. File permissions or size limits

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Functions to Test:
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard without errors
- [ ] Upload a contract (check console for errors)
- [ ] Upload a template
- [ ] Start template analysis
- [ ] View template analysis results
- [ ] Check notification bell shows count
- [ ] Verify notifications appear for all actions

### Known Remaining Issues:
1. TypeScript errors in API routes (unrelated to migration)
2. Some components may need additional testing

## Additional Notes

The migration preserved backward compatibility where needed (like TemplateAnalysis component) while moving to the new notification system. All critical runtime errors should be resolved.

If any issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Restart the development server
