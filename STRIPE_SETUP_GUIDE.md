4. Enter: 7 days
5. Save changes

## Step 6: Get Your API Keys

1. In the Stripe Dashboard, click "Developers" in the left menu
2. Click "API keys"
3. You'll see two important keys:

   - **Secret key** (starts with: sk_test_...)
4. Copy both keys and save them somewhere safe

## Step 7: Set Up Webhooks

1. Still in "Developers", click "Webhooks"
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Fill in:

## Step 8: Add Keys to Your Application

Create or update your `.env.local` file with these values:

```
# Stripe Keys (from Step 6)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE

# Webhook Secret (from Step 7)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE

# Price ID (from Step 4)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID_HERE
```

## Step 9: Test Your Setup

1. Stripe provides test card numbers for testing:
   - Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Expiry: Any future date (like 12/34)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (like 123)
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits (like 12345)

## Step 10: Go Live

When you're ready to accept real payments:

1. In Stripe Dashboard, toggle from "Test mode" to "Live mode"
2. Get your live API keys (they start with pk_live_ and sk_live_)
3. Update your `.env.local` file with the live keys
4. Create your product and price again in live mode
5. Update the webhook with your live website URL

## Important Notes

- **Keep your secret key secret!** Never share it or commit it to GitHub
- Test everything in test mode first
- Stripe takes a fee of 2.9% + 30Â¢ per successful charge
- You'll receive payouts to your bank account on a regular schedule (usually 2-7 days)

## Next Steps for Your Developer

Show this guide to your developer along with the API keys. They'll need to update the code to use just one plan ($100/month with 7-day trial) instead of multiple tiers.
