## Implementation Guidelines

### Styling Requirements
- **STRICT**: Maintain black/white/grey color scheme
- **EXCEPTION**: User cursors and avatars use collaboration colors
- Use existing component patterns and spacing
- Follow current CSS module structure

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce all real-time updates
- Batch presence updates
- Use React.memo for avatar components
- Implement virtual scrolling for long comment threads
- Cache user profiles

### Security Requirements
- Always verify permissions before operations
- Use RLS policies, don't bypass
- Validate all user input
- Rate limit share creation and access requests
- Implement share link expiration

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Create Collaboration Dashboard** - Central hub for all shared content
2. **Implement Collaborative Views** - Real-time editing experience
3. **Add Presence System** - Show who's actively working
4. **Complete Comments UI** - Enable team discussions
5. **Add Track Changes** - Audit trail for compliance
6. **Implement Access Requests** - Handle unauthorized access attempts

## Testing Checklist
